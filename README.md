# grow-a-password

## Description

This project is a password generator. A lot of websites/apps require a unique password at least 8 characters long that are a mix of letters (upper and lowercase), numbers, and/or symbols. This is an easy way to generate a unique one up to 128 characters long.

I tried writing this code 5+ different ways- from creating a generic function to call to and run the code, to creating a working function for each confirm and pass on a new array that could be concatenated in the end. Anything from having one giant long if/else conditional.

They didn't work lol.

This was the code that ran the function and showed the correct output.
